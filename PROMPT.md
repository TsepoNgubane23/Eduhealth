## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

### Supabase Integration Prompt

```
Integrate Supabase as the production database for EduHealth while maintaining SQLite for development:

**Requirements:**
- Replace SQLite with Supabase PostgreSQL for production
- Maintain SQLite fallback for local development
- Update database models for UUID primary keys (Supabase compatibility)
- Configure environment variables for Supabase connection
- Implement automatic fallback system if Supabase connection fails
- Update all database operations to work with both systems

**Configuration Needed:**
- SUPABASE_URL

- Proper foreign key relationships

Ensure the application gracefully handles connection issues and falls back to SQLite when Supabase is unavailable.
```

### Database Configuration Prompt

```
Create a robust database configuration system that:

1. Attempts to connect to Supabase PostgreSQL first
2. Falls back to SQLite if Supabase connection fails
3. Provides clear logging of which database is being used
4. Handles both development and production environments
5. Includes proper error handling and connection validation
6. Updates all models to use UUID primary keys for Supabase compatibility

Include a separate database_config.py file for database setup and initialization.
```

Update EduHealth payment system to support South African Rand (ZAR):

1. Change all pricing from USD to ZAR
2. Update conversion rates (approximate: 1 USD = 18 ZAR)
3. Modify frontend pricing display to show "R" instead of "$"
4. Update Paystack integration to use ZAR currency
5. Adjust payment amounts in backend calculations
